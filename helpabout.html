<h1>DEVELOPER OF THE GAME</h1>
<p>I like to reference myself to as 'we' for some reason. I just like it. Anyway, my name is iProgramMC and I am the developer of Growalone, as some of you might have noticed. I have a friend, called Maxiify, which helped me a lot through the early stages to test. (He didn't even have access to the code!) I am proud to present this game to all of you ;)</p>
