			<h2 style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto"> FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS </h2>
			<p style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto">You might have an important question to ask, but I'm too slow to reply. Here are some questions people ask me sometimes.</p>
			<ul style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto">
				<li><b>How do I join a server?</b><br>To join a local server, click the "Sign in to a local server instead" box. There will be an IP box in the future if you want to join another one.</li><br>
				<li><b>How do I host a server on a VPS?</b><br>Not only do you need to create the server itself, but also an HTTP server that serves this file, located at this (<a href="/multiplayer/mpserverdata.txt">/multiplayer/mpserverdata.txt</a>) link. Then, when players are able to join other servers, you will be able to serve this file and host a server.</li><br>
				<li><b>BUT *INSERT PERSON HERE* OWNS GROWALONE!!1!1!1! WHY ARE YOU DENYING THE TRUTH?????</b><br>I am not.  It is undeniable that I own Growalone and there is lots of proof.</li><br>
				<li><b>I placed a lock on my items, what do I do?</b><br>Sadly I cannot help with that. Accept your loss and move on. Sorry!</li><br>
				<li><b>I locked a block on top of my items and locked it, what do I do?</b><br>You can use a World Lock to lock the world and then take the items from there. But be careful, you can't take anything else once you've locked the world so take them out first. Other than that, the world will be useless, so delete it.</li><br>
				<li><b>I want to change my playername, what do I do?</b><br>Sadly I cannot help with that. You can of course delete playerdata.gai and start over, but that resets EVERYTHING including backpack slots and levels.</li><br>
				<li><b>Can I play with my friends?</b><br>Yes. Despite the title, Grow<b>alone, you are able to play with friends. Just fire up a local server and play!</li><br>
				<li><b>OmG I wAnT t0 BE mOd On tE gMaE pLs</b><br>No. I only hire moderators who have been playing the game for a long time and are trusted by me.</li><br>
				<li><b>Where do you live?</b><br>To protect my anonimity, I don't post personal information about myself yet.</li><br>
				<li><b>I encountered a glitch in the game!</b><br>Join the Discord server or shoot me an email explaining what you have done. If you/I cannot reproduce the glitch then I cannot help you, sorry.</li><br>
				<li><b>Why is your name iProgramInCpp?</b><br>I program in C++ too! And C++ was the first language I learned, too.</li><br>
