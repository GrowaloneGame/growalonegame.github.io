    <p>Growalone is a sandbox 2D game for PCs. It was made <strike>in XNA with C#</strike> with Monogame and the .NET Framework. Feel free to try it! </p>

    <h1>COMPATIBILITY</h1>
    <h2>
        The game will *not* work with Windows XP. It requires .NET Framework 4.5, that's why. And also, because MonoGame doesn't support .NET Framework 4.0.
        The game WILL, however, work with Windows 7 and newer.
    </h2>

Or go to the <a href="helpabout.html">Help and About</a> page!</p>

Sorry for not updating the game in that long. I have been busy doing other projects and not working on the game.
    
Android support is coming soon!
