      <h2>1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES AND LIMITED LICENSE TO USE SERVICES</h2>
      <p class="pt1">
        These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) sets forth the agreement between iProgramInCpp and each user (“you” or “User”). The Terms govern your use of iProgramInCpp’s websites, online games, online functions of offline games, any other online functions controlled by iProgramInCpp or mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”)
        <br><br>
        iProgramInCpp reserves the right to change, modify, add, or delete clauses in these Terms at any time. The “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms will indicate when the latest modifications were made. By continuing to access and use the Services after these Terms have been modified, you are agreeing to such modifications. The Services are for your individual, non-commercial, entertainment purposes only. Except as may be expressly permitted by the Terms, you may not sell or exchange anything you copy or derive from the Services. As long as you comply with these Terms, iProgramInCpp grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right during the term of these Terms to enter, use, perform, and display the Services and everyone on it. You agree not to interrupt or attempt to interrupt the operation of the Services in any way.
      </p>
      <h2>2. ACCOUNT</h2>
      <p class="pt2">
        Access to and use of certain additional functions and/or benefits of the Services are subject to the creation of an account with iProgramInCpp (the "Account"). If you do not have an Account opened with iProgramInCpp, you may create one in the Growalone application.
        <br><br>
        To create an Account, you must have an email address or any other publicly available information (but excluding phone numbers) and supply truthful and accurate information. You must be authorized to use the Services for which you register, and in particular meet the age criteria. Certain Services may require the creation of a "Username" or "Avatar". Usernames and avatars are linked to your account and used to log onto your account. You can't use a username which is already used by someone else, which does not meet the requirements of these Terms or the ethical rules which apply on the Internet, or which is insulting, vulgar, obscene, defamatory or in any other way in violation of the rights of others (name rights and image rights). Growalone advises you not to include your real surname (first name is acceptable) in your Username. You agree to your Username being publicly displayed within and/or outside the Services. iProgramInCpp reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel, a username in its sole discretion.<br><br>
        
        You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and any user IDs, passwords, authentication codes or other security devices or procedures (collectively "Password"). Do not reveal the Password of your account to outside parties. We are not responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account. iProgramInCpp will <b>never</b> ask you to reveal your Password and will never take the initiative of contacting you to ask you for your Password. We reserve the right to suspend your access to the Services and change (or require you to change) your Password at any time. Any use of your Account with your Password, and in particular any use of Services, is deemed to be carried out by you.
        <br><br>
        If any contact details (including username and email address) change, you agree to notify iProgramInCpp in writing within 30 (thirty) days of the occurrence of such changes. 
        <br><br><br>
        You agree to supply true, accurate, up-to-date and complete personal information and keep it up to date in accordance with iProgramInCpp's requests in the registration process.
        <br><br>
        You shall not claim to be any other person or entity and shall not represent your identity or an affiliation with any other person or entity in an inaccurate way, including by using the User Name, password or any other info relating to someone else's Account or the name, likeness, voice or image of another person.
        <br><br>
        If you provide any information that is false, inaccurate, outdated, impersonating and/or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect such info is false, inaccurate, outdated, impersonating and/or incomplete, iProgramInCpp has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the Services by you.
        <br><br>
        You also agree to inform iProgramInCpp as fast as possible at growalonegame@gmail.com, ipmcmcpe729@gmail.com or at Discord at iProgramInCpp#0489 of any unauthorized use of your username, password or other info concerning your Account or of any other security violation concerning or involving the Services which comes to your attention.
